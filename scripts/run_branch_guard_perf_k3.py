"""Run a pinned Kimi-K3 disaggregated performance guard through bench-trtllm-disagg.

This is the K3 counterpart of ``run_branch_guard_perf.py``. The two are kept
separate on purpose: the DSV4 guard drives ``srtctl`` against SHA-pinned
srt-slurm recipes and reads AIPerf CSV, whereas the measured K3 points live in
the ``bench-trtllm-disagg`` harness (``trtllm_config.yaml`` + ``submit.py``) and
report through two different result formats. Folding both into one script would
have meant a mode flag on essentially every function.

``--preset`` selects one Python-defined bundle containing an immutable reference
workdir, topology, workload shape, reference metrics, and gate policy. The
reference ``trtllm_config.yaml`` is SHA-256 checked before use, so edits under
the shared reference tree cannot silently move the baseline.

Two presets exist, one per measured reference run:

* ``k3-genonly-helix8-c16-mtp5`` - GEN-only, helix8 / concurrency 16 / MTP5.
  Reference: job 605293 (``.../k3-nsys-fp4-vs-fp8/fp4-job605293-mr10675fix``),
  the post-MR!10675 FP4 point. Results are read from the ``trtllm`` bench
  client's ``result.json`` plus the per-iteration ``gen_only_0.txt`` log.
* ``k3-ctxonly-dep16-c96`` - CTX-only, dep16 / concurrency 96.
  Reference: job 586472 (``.../k3-ctx-baseline-job586472``), the 7.66 req/s
  baseline. Results are read from AIPerf's ``profile_export_aiperf.csv``.

Reference metrics are per cluster, not per preset. The same config on R200
(hecate) and on GB300 (oci-jhb) produces different absolute numbers, so each
preset carries one ``ClusterReference`` per cluster it has been measured on and
the guard picks the set matching wherever it is running. The cluster is detected
from Slurm's ``ClusterName``, falling back to a filesystem marker unique to each
site; detection never guesses, because grading a GB300 run against R200 numbers
would report a confident verdict about the wrong hardware. ``--cluster`` forces
it. Cluster-dependent defaults -- account, partition, constraint, guard home,
benchmark repo -- follow the detected cluster too.

Useful modes:

* ``--list-presets``: show available presets without requiring runtime inputs.
* ``--result-dir DIR``: evaluate an existing result directory without submitting.
* ``--dry-run``: prepare and validate the config without submitting.
* ``--cluster NAME``: force the cluster instead of detecting it.
* ``--establish-reference``: run and report metrics without gating them, for a
  cluster that has no baseline yet. Prints a pasteable ``ClusterReference``.

Examples::

    # Show both presets.
    python3 scripts/run_branch_guard_perf_k3.py --list-presets

    # Re-evaluate the reference run itself (self-check; every gate must pass).
    python3 scripts/run_branch_guard_perf_k3.py \
        --preset k3-genonly-helix8-c16-mtp5 --self-check

    # Prepare and validate without submitting.

        #    quantization eligibility changed before launch" --
        #    can_fuse_fp4_mla_q_quant carried a redundant

        #    SM103. Zero occurrences from job 532131 on.
        #
        # 3. FIXED (ctx_gpu_memory_fraction 0.53, gen-only preset). Job 531579's
        #    context worker OOMed at 0.8. Job 532131 measured a 63.5849 GiB

        #    and SM103 selects "triton". This is not a gate someone tightened:
        #    grepping softmax_stats in fp4_mla_kernels.py returns nothing, so
        #    the Triton path has no such kernel to call. Relaxing the check
        #    would reach an implementation that does not exist. Until that
        #    kernel is written, k3-genonly-helix8-c16-mtp5 cannot run on GB300,
        #    and it cannot be configured around either -- helix8 is the point of
        #    the preset.
        #
        # 5. OPEN, ctx-only preset, needs a lever the guard does not have. Job
        #    532135 got its CONTEXT server up and serving -- the harness printed
        #    "Waiting for servers, context: []" -- and then its GEN worker OOMed
        #    at gen-side free_gpu_memory_fraction 0.8. This was invisible until
        #    4 and 2 were fixed, because the GEN worker used to die earlier.
        #    Ledger, per rank: 67.32 GiB free at the kv_cache stage, quota
        #    min(0.8 x 67.32, max_tokens 56.69) = 53.85 GiB -- so unlike case 3
        #    the fraction already binds here and lowering it does do something.
        #    "Additional executor resources" then wanted 27.53 GiB against 20.10
        #    GiB free on the best rank and 19.42 GiB on the worst: deficits of
        #    7.43 and 8.11 GiB. 0.60 would return 13.46 GiB and clear the worst
        #    rank by 5.35 GiB; 0.68 lands 0.03 GiB short of it. The larger
        #    footprint is plausibly a direct cost of 2: CUTEDSL is the two-op
        #    backend and materialises intermediates the fused FC12 kernel does
        #    not. --ctx-gpu-memory-fraction rewrites ctx_config only, by
        #    design, so there is no gen-side equivalent to set today.

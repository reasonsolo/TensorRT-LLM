uGPU Localization: Policy and Runtime layers.

This package provides a clean separation of concerns for uGPU execution:
- layout: Logical/padded shape and partition-slice metadata
- policy: Planning decisions (enable/disable, partition count, backend selection)
- runtime: Stream/mempool/event management
